# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project is the fourth challenge from the U of A coding bootcamp. It is a simple app that saves daily events to local storage and loads them on the screen even if the page has been closed or reloaded. The colors of the text areas change depending on whether the time block is in the past, present, or future. In this project, I utilized Bootstrap to style the time blocks and JQuery for most of the coding in the script.js document. While the code currently uses the Moments.js API for dates and time, I am researching other options for the sake of learning more updated methods. Condital statements, loops, and event listeners are some of the other coding methods I used to dynamically change the color of the textarea depending on the time, save data to local storage, and load data from local storage. 

Through the process of writing this code, I really appreciated how much simpler writing JQuery was compared to vanilla JavaScript. Seeing as JQuery is not utlized as much as it used to be, I'm motivated to look at other options that would help me simplify the process of writing JavaScript. On the other hand, though Bootstrap really simplifies some CSS tools like Grid, it also makes the HTML look cluttered and hard to read. So I will look at ways to simplify using Bootstrap in my future code.
